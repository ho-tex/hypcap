# hypcap package for LaTeX

* hypcap: adjusting anchors of captions;


This package tries a solution of the problem with
hyperref, that links to floats points below the
caption and not at the beginning of the float.
Therefore this package divides the task into two
part, the link setting with `\capstart` or
automatically at the beginning of a float and
the rest in the `\caption` command.
